# Who I Am

I'm Elahi, a passionate Computer Engineering student on a journey through the exciting world of computers.

# What I Do

I'm currently both studying and working as a Software Developer Intern at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, where I translate academic knowledge into practical solutions that solve real problems.
# Always Learning

I'm always hungry for knowledge and eternally curious about all things, which is great for a student of a field that involves a process of never-ending learning.

I'm currently learning about the fields of DevOps and Cyber Security in my work and free time, respectively.

# Key Points of My Work

My current work as an intern involves many tasks. Mainly I:

- **Actively contribute** to the development of two pivotal web applications: one for International Students and the other for students pursuing a Masters in Secondary Education.
- **Collaborate closely** with university administrative personnel to understand requirements, leading to the design and implementation of new features tailored to their needs.
- Play a **key role in enhancing the efficiency** of the International Students' documentation submission process by automating a previously manual email-based system.
- Regularly **address and resolve software bugs**, ensuring the smooth operation of web applications and enhancing user experience.
- Diligently **document project developments**, facilitating easier future modifications and understanding for other team members.
- **Initiated the setup of a DevOps pipeline** using GitLab, which automates code testing on each commit and checks project dependencies for potential vulnerabilities, laying the groundwork for future enhancements.
- Utilize a diverse tech stack, including Python (Django), HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Vue.js, Docker, SQL (via DBeaver), and extensive command line operations.
- **Work cohesively in a dynamic team** of four, comprising two interns and two full-time employees, fostering a collaborative and efficient work environment.
- Engage in **proactive self-learning** during work hours, gain familiarity with JavaScript and Django through comprehensive documentation review and hands-on experimentation.
- **Exercise strong communication skills**, liaise effectively with clients and team members, and showcase adept problem-solving capabilities through consistent bug fixes and feature enhancements.

# Beyond Computers

My interests outside of the computer domain are many and diverse. I love to engage in all forms of media, from movies and shows to video games, music, and books. I love cooking. I love to meet new people and learn as much as I can from them.

Among my current daily learning routines are learning guitar, and learning Swedish and German.
