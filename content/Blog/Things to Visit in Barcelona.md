# Some of My Favourite Spots
I mostly like to have my visiting friends hike to high places from which we get a good view of the city. I'm like a cat in that sense. But with friends.
## Bunkers
Beautiful view of the city from what used to be a 1930s anti-air bunker located right in the middle of the city
## Mirador Collserola
A view that spans the entire city from the mountain that lies right beside it. It's a proper hike (plan for a whole afternoon), but it's SO worth it.
## Montjuïc Castle
Pretty good on a hill that's right by the sea. On one side you can see the port with the big containers and the big-ass cranes. On the other you can see the city. On both sides you can see the sea. Good to wonder at both the expanse of nature and human ingenuity. Also good if you want to look at trees.
# Big Buildings
Not my favourite thing to see but I like that they're there.
## Sagrada Família
The most Barcelona building in Barcelona. It's been in construction since the dawn of time. Visit this if you want to look like a tourist and feel like a tourist and mostly just be a tourist.
## Casa Batlló
This building earns second spot on the Everyone That Looks At This Is Clearly A Tourist Award every single year. It's a building. It's kinda cool. Go buildings I guess.
## La Pedrera
The third building in this list that's built by Gaudí. Fun fact: He died when he was ran over by a tram. Maybe it's not that funny, but you can't say it's too soon because it happened almost two hundred years ago.
## Catalonia's National Art Museum
Hey look we're a nation!
Probably the coolest museum we have in my humble opinion. It's also here on the building list because it's pretty to look at.
## Arc de Triomf
It's like Paris' Arc de Triomphe but smaller. It's also called the same because Catalan and French are twinsies.
## Agbar Tower
Also called Barcelona's Penis. You'll know it when you see it.
# Museums
You could easily spend at least two hours in each of these so tread with caution.
## Catalonia's National Art Museum
Already mentioned on this list and a personal favorite, it has a LOT and you'll probably want to be here for a whole afternoon. 
## CosmoCaixa
A super-cool science museum that you should visit at least once. It's also a plan for a whole morning or afternoon so keep that in mind.
## CCCB
Modern art museum, so my advice is to check what's on there so you know what you're getting into.
## Picasso Museum
Might be the place to go if you're into the guy.
## Museum of History of Catalonia/Barcelona
Actually two separate museums, and I honestly don't remember which one is the super-cool Roman excavation one but it's definitely one of the two.
## Erotic Museum
Spicy.
# Parks & Nature

## Parc Güell
Another cool thing that Gaudí did that has been cashed by the city. It's a park but it's also art.
## Parc de la Ciutadella
Big-ass park (by Barcelona standards anyway) that's right in the middle of the city and close to a lot of worthwhile things to see. It's a good place to hang out.
## Montjuïc
The hill that's by the sea. It has a castle on top. It's pretty. 
## Collserola
This one is outside the city but it's also the most nature that you'll be able to see while visiting this city. Plan accordingly.
## Parc de les Aigües
Personal favorite since it's less than a 5 minute walk from my place. It's also where I did most of my birthday parties from ages 5 to like 15.
# Cafés

## Eixampeling
Everything about this place is cute. Decoration and food are on point. There might be a bit of a queue on peak hours so plan accordingly.
## Alsur Café
Great food, good spot to chill.
## La Desayunería
Mostly a place to eat, not to stay, since it's so busy the staff will hover around you nervously if you're finished but aren't leaving. The food is amazing though.
# Bars

## BeerCab
Great bar to go if you like craft beers and/or you're hungry. Both beers and food are amazing.
## Candy Darling
A bar in the city center that's full of cool-looking people. Some of those people are actually cool too.
## L'Ovella Negra
Default pre-drinks tavern for all students both domestic and international. It gets VERY busy after 22 so plan accordingly.
## AirBar
Cheaper pre-drinks option. It gets VERY busy, but a bit later, as it gets full of the people from L'Ovella.
# Clubs

## Razzmatazz
Default club for students. Not too expensive, pretty big, fulla people. It has different rooms with different music genres, with the main room being the standard popular hits. Fun times.
## Apolo
Another good option and a bit cheaper than Razz. Also a bit smaller. Alas, you can't have everything.
## Believe
An LGBTQ+ place which means it's automatically safer for women. Sad but it's what it is.
# Bonus section: Clubs to avoid
These are notorious tourist traps and you shouldn't go unless you're either rich, well-connected, a white-collar criminal, or a drug dealer. They don't merit their section so I'm just gonna list them.
* Cocoa
* Opium
* Shoko
* Pacha
* Sutton
* Otto
* City Hall
