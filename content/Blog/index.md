title: My personal word garden
---
Welcome to my blog! Here be a collection of my thoughts and ideas about pretty much anything I consider relevant. 

Like many things in this site, I have been inspired by Jacky Zhao for this section, in particular by their [ideas on digital gardening](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought). You might find more structured and organized content over at [[Projects/index|Projects]], as it focuses more on my career, while navigating this part is more akin to walking through a garden. My hope is you will find among the flowers something you didn't know you were looking for.
