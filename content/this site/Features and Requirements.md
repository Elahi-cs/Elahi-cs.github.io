* It uses a framework for which I don't have to spend a lot of time learning how to do basic things (e.g Flask or Django)
* It doesn't look like a default Bootstrap page. It's pretty to look at but doesn't have a very elaborate frontend (a cool template will suffice)
* It allows me to spend less time tinkering with HTML and CSS and more focusing on writing for and showcasing my projects.
* It needs to have the following sections:
	* Home section that shows my name and my job title/field/wished title
	* About section that sums up where I am, where I work, and where I can be found.
	* Projects section that showcases my latest projects.
	* Blog section that will have article posts and tags that connect the posts. It might also be organized in categories depending on the tags it has.
	* (optional/maybe) Contact form
* It won't have an auth system, all the articles and tags will be static Markdown files instead of POSTed content so I don't have to think too hard about security.
* It needs a way to render Markdown into the full page.
* There has to be some way to easily get an article from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault to the blog without too much friction.
* The overall cost (e.g hosting fees, domain name) has to be cheaper than just hosting it on Obsidian Publish (8$/month) or WordPress (9â‚¬/month plus domain name).

* [Writer Muriel Vega has great section ordering and very tidy post organization](https://www.murielvega.net/)
* [Speechwriter Helena Bowen has a simple Articles/Portfolio division that works very well](https://helenabowen.com/)
* [Product Designer Greg Chen has a simple but powerful site focusing on his works](https://www.guanbaic.com/). Maybe a great example for when I have more stuff to show.

After some careful consideration it will be time to move on to [[Design Choices]].
